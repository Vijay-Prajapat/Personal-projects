Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

The motive of the project is to convert the image from RBG format to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is to invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Then finally created the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image.Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.

The jupyter notebook file (with the extention : ipynb) is compressed due to size issues , so to run that in your PC or notebook you must have to first download and extract it.
