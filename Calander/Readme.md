The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world. There are leap years in the Gregorian calendar. There are 303 regular years and 97 leap years in a four-hundred-year span. The majority of people believe that every fourth year is a leap year, although this is not the case.A leap year is one in which the year is divisible by four. It is not a leap year, however, if the year is divisible by 100. It is, nevertheless, a leap year if the year is also divisible by 400.
